## PyTTa - Python in Technical Acoustics

The project began as an effort to create audio, acoustics and vibrational data acquiring and analysis toolbox to a free cost level, high end results, combining the passion for programming with the expertise in acoustics and vibration of the Acoustics Engineers from the Federal University of Santa Maria.

We are students, teachers, engineers, passionates and inquiring people, on the first steps of a journey throughout the Python path to bring Acoustics to the Open Seas, Open Sources and Open World!
