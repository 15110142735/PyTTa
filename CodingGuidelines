For now we don't have many rules, but you should consider the subsequent one.

The names should be written as:

    - ClassName;
    - method_name;
    - propertyName;
    - function_name;
    - variableName;
    - modulename.

As far as concrete guidelines, just imitate the existing code. Keep things organized.
