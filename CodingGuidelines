For now we don't have many rules, but you should consider the subsequent one.

The names in the code should be written as:

    - ClassName;
    - method_name;
    - propertyName;
    - function_name;
    - variableName;
    - modulename.

The commit messages must carry some suffix. This way, in the future, we can use this to generate release notes. They are:

    Annotation  Description             Exemple git commit
    [INTERNAL]  used for internal stuff git commit -m "[INTERNAL] update .gitignore"
    [FIX]       contains bugfix         git commit -m "[FIX] SignalObj.__truediv__ bug fix"
    [FEATURE]   contains new feature    git commit -m "[FEATURE] introduced Analysis"
    [DOC]       contains documentation  git commit -m "[DOC] introduced Analysis documentation"


As far as concrete guidelines, just imitate the existing code. Keep things organized.
